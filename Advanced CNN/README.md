## Overview

The exercise includes the following objectives:

- Applying data preprocessing and augmentation using `torchvision.transforms`
- Utilizing pre-trained CNN architectures from `torchvision.models`
- Modifying existing models for custom classification tasks
- Training and fine-tuning models with real-world data
- Visualizing predictions, activations, and bounding boxes
- Comparing performance across models and techniques

This notebook emphasizes scalable and efficient workflows using modern deep learning libraries and tools.
