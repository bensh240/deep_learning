# Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

This notebook contains the complete solution for Homework 1, focusing on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using NumPy and applying it to the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset.

---

## Overview

This assignment includes the following components:

- Downloading and preparing the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Implementing utility functions for data preprocessing and visualization
- Building and training a simple CNN using NumPy
- Visualizing filters, feature maps, and learned weights
- Analyzing model performance and conducting basic hyperparameter tuning

The objective is to provide a foundational understanding of how CNNs operate at a low level, without relying on high-level deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
