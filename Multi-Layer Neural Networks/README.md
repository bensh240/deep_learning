# HMulti-Layer Neural Networks

This notebook implements a three-layer fully connected neural network for multi-class classification. It builds upon foundational concepts introduced in previous assignments and introduces modular design through external Python modules.

---

## Overview

The exercise covers the following topics:

- Construction of a three-layer neural network using modular Python code
- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient checking
- Parameter updates using stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- Performance evaluation on classification tasks

This notebook provides all the scaffolding and structure required to complete the assignment step-by-step.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit **only this Jupyter notebook** (`HW2_315856484.ipynb`)
- Do **not** submit any zipped folders or additional files
- Ensure all functions are implemented in the corresponding Python modules, not within the notebook

---

## Technical Requirements

- Use efficient **vectorized implementations**
- Do **not** modify provided function signatures unless explicitly instructed
- External dependencies (such as NumPy) are allowed
- Add your own unit tests where appropriate to ensure correctness

## Setup Instructions

- Python version: 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib (optional for visualization)

To install the required packages, run:

```python
%pip install numpy matplotlib
